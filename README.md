# ROP-Prediction
The aim of this project is to predict ROP, by analyzing the drilling parameters, geological characteristics, and other relevant factors. Through this project, we can analyze the factors that affect ROP and also predict ROP. Moreover, this will help engineers to optimize the ROP during the drilling process.
